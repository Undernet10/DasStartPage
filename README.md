DasHomeNewPage
==============

A simple but functional homepage/new tab page that tells the time, shows your favorite links, and tells your location. (Everything is customizable!)

This is a fork of Suzuismywaifu's homepage, and is no way a replacement for it. I simply customized for my needs.

Here is Suzuismywaifu's homepage: https://github.com/Suzuismywaifu/My-homepage

Installation
==============

To set as a new tab page, you must first download a addon/extension assuming you are using either Firefox or Chrome.

For Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/custom-new-tab/?src=userprofile

For Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/define-your-own-new-tab/nhjjapmfhhmcikhcfkiolockmndbbpng

After that, you can download this package zipped with this repository, put the folder in a safe place, and customize it to your liking! (Unless you want to use the links, and you don't want that do you?)

To set as a home page, simply navigate to your options/settings in Chrome or Firefox and set the URL to the file directory of html file.

Compatibility
===============

Tested on Firefox on a 1920 x 1080 monitor. 

I have no idea if it'll work on other browser or smaller or bigger screen resolution. So you'll have fix things yourself.
